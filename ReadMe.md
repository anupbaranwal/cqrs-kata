## CQRS KATA
### This is a KATA application which is built on Java 8 and spring boot.
The clear idea of CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation ) as name suggests is to segregate the code based on the their responsibility.
It not just provides a clean code but also a well maintainable application.
